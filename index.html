      </div>
      <div class="stuff">
        <p>Social psychology studies how people interact with others in their environment. Experiments study conformity (Asch), obedience (Milgram), role conformity (Zimbardo), social facilitation/inhibition/loafing, and attraction. While social psychology may seem like it is skewed towards "nurture" in the nature-nurture debate, social psychology concepts are based on cognition concepts (such as interpreting information into schemas, which build biases), as well as biological concepts (stress responses during noncomformity in group settings).</p>

      </div>
      <div class="stuff">
        <p>Behavioral psychology is far on the right end of nature-nurture spectrum. It studies classical conditioning (developing connections between two unrelated stimuli and subconsciously changing behavior in response) and operant conditioning (shaping behavior in response to reinforcement and punishment). Some experiments to note would be Pavlov’s Dog experiment, and Watson’s Little Albert experiment. Classical and behavior conditioning is applied to many situations, such as counterconditioning people with phobias, and finding the right parenting style.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Cognitive Psychology</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="stuff">
        <p>Cognitive psychology focuses on how we interpret situations, and how information is structured inside our minds. It discusses the different processes behind remembering and retrieving information, coming up with solutions, and biases and errors in how we think. Cognitive psychology is also the driving force behind many therapy styles -- for example, the Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT) method, developed by Albert Ellis, focuses on changing irrational thoughts and cognitive distortions in thinking, to help people live happier lives.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Developmental Psychology</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="stuff">
        <p>Developmental psychology focuses on how we develop as time passes. It follows Piaget’s theories of cognitive development, Kohlberg’s stages of moral development, Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development, Freud’s stages as well. There is also a lot of debate surrounding language development, as some people believe we are born with an innate understanding of grammar (Chomsky), while others believe language is acquired only through environmental exposure (BF Skinner).</p>

        <h1 class="title">Biological Psychology</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="stuff">
        <p>Biological psychology is about the biological processes that underly behavior and cognition. It talks in detail about brain structure, neurons, endocrine system, and other processes and functionalities. As one may predict, biological psychology is nature-heavy. Biological psychology also discusses the science behind hormones and neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, cortisol, dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins. Naturally, many biomedical therapy medications have stemmed as a result of behavioral psychology studies -- for example, antidepressants are a form of medication aimed to block the reuptake of serotonin (such as SSRIs) to promote serotonin supply.</p>
